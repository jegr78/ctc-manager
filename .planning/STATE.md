# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-24)

**Core value:** Architectural Consistency: All controllers delegate to services, exception handling is centralized, and the production environment is secured.
**Current focus:** Phase 56 — model-schema-foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 56 (model-schema-foundation) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 5
No active milestone. v1.8 shipped 2026-04-25 (PR #116 squash-merged as `042cfbf`, archived in `.planning/milestones/v1.8-*`).

Last activity: 2026-04-26 -- Phase 56 execution started

## Completed Milestones

- v1.0 Technical Debt Cleanup (5 phases, 12 plans) — shipped 2026-04-04
- v1.1 Codebase Concerns Cleanup (10 phases, 20 plans) — shipped 2026-04-07
- v1.2 Driver Merge (4 phases, 5 plans) — shipped 2026-04-07
- v1.3 English Test Data (8 phases) — shipped 2026-04-10
- v1.5 Code Review Fixes (9 phases, 14 plans) — shipped 2026-04-15
- v1.6 Static Site Quality (17 phases, 56 requirements) — shipped 2026-04-18
- v1.8 Bulk Driver Import from Google Sheets (2 phases, 4 plans, +52 tests) — shipped 2026-04-25

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

- [v1.8 start]: Foundation document is `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-24-bulk-driver-import-design.md` — authored via `/gsd-explore` brainstorming; approved as canonical design before milestone kickoff.
- [v1.8 start]: Reuse `GoogleSheetsService`, `DriverMatchingService` (4-stage fuzzy), and `CsvImportService` preview-state pattern — no parallel infrastructure.
- [v1.8 start]: Missing Seasons/Teams are errors, never auto-created — consistent with "No Fallback Calculations" principle.
- [v1.8 start]: E2E tests deferred (Playwright × Google Sheets mocking is fragile); Unit + Integration tests must meet 82% coverage gate.
- [v1.8 roadmap]: Two-phase structure chosen over three-phase split. Rationale: Controller+templates+execute form a single cohesive deliverable — splitting preview-controller from execute-controller would ship a non-verifiable intermediate (preview form with no execute path). Phase 54 delivers a fully unit-tested service; Phase 55 delivers the end-to-end admin flow with integration coverage.

### Phase Numbering

Continuing from v1.6 (last phase: 53). v1.8 phases start at **Phase 54**.

- Phase 54: Preview Service & Row Categorization (17 requirements)
- Phase 55: Admin Import UI & Transactional Execute (11 requirements)

### Key Technical Context

- Target entities: `Driver` (psnId unique, nickname, active, aliases), `SeasonDriver(season, driver, team)`.
- Sheet structure: tabs named `^\d{4}$`; column A = `PSN ID`, column C = `Team` short code. Hidden column B is ignored.
- Admin entry point: new page at `/admin/drivers/import` (button on `/admin/drivers`).
- Controller routes: `GET /admin/drivers/import`, `POST /admin/drivers/import/preview`, `POST /admin/drivers/import/execute`.
- No Flyway migration required.
- Reuse mandated: `GoogleSheetsService.extractSpreadsheetId()/getSheetNames()/readRangeFromSheet()`, `DriverMatchingService` 4-stage logic. Preview-state between preview and execute uses **re-fetch + form-params** (mirroring `CsvImportController.execute()`), **not** `@SessionAttributes` — confirmed during Phase 54 codebase scout (see `.planning/phases/54-preview-service-row-categorization/54-CONTEXT.md` D-06).

### Blockers/Concerns

None.

## Session Continuity

**Next action:** v1.8 milestone closed and archived. Project is between milestones.

- v1.8 Tag pushen: `git push origin v1.8` (lokales Tag wartet)
- `/gsd-new-milestone` — questioning → research → requirements → roadmap für v1.9 (oder nächste Version)
- `/gsd-progress` — aktueller Snapshot (zeigt: keine aktive Milestone, alle Phasen archiviert)

**Branch:** `master` (after v1.8 merge — feature branch deleted locally and remotely).
