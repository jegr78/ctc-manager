# CTC Manager — Gran Turismo Racing League Manager

## What This Is

Gran Turismo Racing League Management application (Spring Boot 4 / Thymeleaf / MariaDB). Manages Seasons, Matchdays, Matches, Races, Teams, Drivers, Scoring, and Standings for the Community Team Cup league. After four milestone cycles (v1.0 Tech Debt, v1.1 Concerns Cleanup, v1.3 English Test Data, v1.5 Code Review Fixes), the codebase is architecturally clean, security-hardened, convention-compliant, and production-ready.

## Core Value

Architectural Consistency: All controllers delegate to services, exception handling is centralized, and the production environment is secured.

## Current State (after v1.10 shipped 2026-05-16)

- **Codebase:** ~17k LOC Java (Prod) + ~25k LOC Java (Tests); 1652 Surefire unit + 231 Failsafe IT + 36 Playwright E2E; JaCoCo line coverage **87.80 %** (gate 82 %, comfort buffer 5.80 pp)
- **Tech Stack:** Spring Boot 4.0.6, Java 25, MariaDB 11 / H2, Thymeleaf 3.1.5 (pinned), Playwright 1.59.0, Lombok 1.18.46 (JEP 498 `--sun-misc-unsafe-memory-access=allow`), Guava 33.4.8-jre (override for `AbstractFuture` Unsafe warning)
- **Security:** HTTP Basic Auth (prod/docker), SSRF hostname blocklist, path traversal defense, CSRF tokens on AJAX POSTs + every backup POST endpoint, SpEL/OGNL injection validation, Content-Disposition sanitization, MatchdayForm DTO (mass assignment protection), ZIP-Slip + ZipBomb defenses on backup import (50 MB/entry, 500 MB total, 50.000 entries cap, `startsWith(uploadDir.toRealPath())` check)
- **Architecture:** Clean 3-tier (Controller → Service → Repository), no God Services, centralized exception handling, domain services fully decoupled from admin layer, RaceLineup as source of truth for driver-team assignment, sitegen decomposed into 5 page-generator beans + SiteSlugger + TemplateWriter, dedicated `org.ctc.backup.*` package (controller + service + io + dto + audit + lock + event + restore + schema + serialization 24 MixIns + 24 EntityRestorers)
- **Database:** 36 FK-Indexes, 28 @EntityGraph annotations, Flyway V1-V7 (V7 = `data_import_audit` for import provenance); Phase/Group model: `season_phases`, `season_phase_groups`, `phase_teams` tables driving Matchday and Playoff phase association
- **Templates:** CSS utility classes instead of inline styles, TemplateManageable generic dispatch, controller-side `pageTitle` model attributes replace fragment-parameter ternaries across ~80 admin + site templates (Thymeleaf 3.1.5 SpEL canonicalization compliance); `TemplateRenderingSmokeIT` + `exec-maven-plugin` grep-gate fence regression; phase-/group-aware public site templates
- **Data:** All UI text and code comments in English, dev profile with fictive test data including GROUPS multi-phase fixture (Season 2023) + Empty-Phase fixture for D-22 coverage; **backup wire contract** locks 24-entity scope via JPA-Metamodel topo-sort (Kahn), `BackupSchema.SCHEMA_VERSION = 1`, `manifest.json` first-entry ZIP layout
- **Public Site:** Phase-tab row + group-sub-tab row, per-phase URL variants, Phase Breakdown sections on team/driver profiles, alltime aggregation across all phases (D-19 TRACKED BEHAVIOR CHANGE), desktop sticky table headers
- **Admin Features:** `/admin/backup` page with streamed ZIP export (CSRF-protected `POST /admin/backup/export`, `StreamingResponseBody`, ISO-instant filename) + manifest-first preview + replace-all import (`@Transactional` wipe + `JdbcTemplate.batchUpdate` restore bypassing `AuditingEntityListener` + post-commit upload-tree stage-and-rename); concurrent-import `ReentrantLock` + persistent yellow read-only banner + `ImportLockedWriteRejector` HandlerInterceptor + synchronous auto-backup-before-import safety net; 24h recovery retention at `data/.import-backups/<ts>/`
- **Docker / CI:** Both Dockerfile stages pinned to `eclipse-temurin:25-{jdk,jre}-noble` (Playwright 1.59.0 compatibility); `dockerfile-noble-pin-guard` CI job (whitelist-on-suffix); full `docker build .` on every PR + push to master; ci.yml concurrency block + `--no-transfer-progress`; Surefire `forkCount=2C` + Failsafe default-it `forkCount=1C` + `excludedGroups=flaky` quarantine

## Current Milestone

(None — v1.10 shipped 2026-05-16. Next milestone definition via `/gsd-new-milestone`. Carried over candidates tracked in REQUIREMENTS.md "Future Requirements" and ROADMAP.md Phase 999.1–999.4 backlog: OpenRewrite, Clean-Code enforcement, Renovate, SAST.)

**Carried over from v1.10 deferred (candidates für nachgelagerte v1.11+ Milestones):**

- 12 REVIEW.md Info/Warning items from Phase 75 (backup-cleanup mini-phase)
- D-06 wallclock-reduction debt (achieved 16.85 %, target ≥ 30 %; requires architectural test-restructuring — Spring-context-per-fork is structural cost)
- Driver-detail Season-Assignment chip ordering (cosmetic; explicit `ORDER BY year` on `Driver.seasonAssignments`)
- `DevDataSeeder` `@Profile` widening for live-MariaDB-UAT bootstrap on `local,demo`
- Nyquist `*-VALIDATION.md` draft → approved for 6 phases + creation for phases 71 + 78
- Wiki QUAL-05 image render verification post-merge (self-resolves on PR merge to master)
- PLAT-CI-02 release-workflow run on master observation (by-design post-merge)

**Carried over from v1.9 deferred (still candidates for v1.11+):**

- Per-group matchday generation UI affordance (`SeasonController.generateMatchdays:251` Rule-3 deviation)
- `StandingsController.java:139` lazy collection style cleanup
- UAT-02 (legacy season visual smoke against real pre-V4 production data) on next deploy

### Active

(None — awaiting next milestone definition via `/gsd-new-milestone`.)

### Out of Scope

- OAuth2/OIDC — Basic Auth sufficient for single-admin app
- Full Pagination UI — only repository preparation, no template rework
- Disable OSIV — deliberately enabled, only @EntityGraph as optimization
- Modify Flyway V1 migration — checksum-protected
- Form Login / User Management — over-engineered for admin tool

## Constraints

- **Test Coverage**: 82% line coverage minimum
- **Flyway**: Do not change existing migrations, only new ones
- **Profiles**: Auth only for prod/docker, dev/local remain without auth
- **OSIV**: Remains enabled — only @EntityGraph as optimization
- **Backward Compatibility**: No breaking changes to existing URLs/endpoints
- **Playwright**: Remains compile-scope dependency (runtime usage for graphics)

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Architecture refactoring before auth | Clean service layer makes auth integration easier | ✓ Validated |
| Basic Auth instead of Form Login | Single-admin app, no user management needed | ✓ v1.0 |
| Auth only prod/docker profiles | Dev/local without network exposure | ✓ v1.0 |
| RaceManagementService split | 673 lines, 13 dependencies → 3 services | ✓ v1.0 |
| Two-profile SecurityFilterChain | @Profile-based instead of runtime check | ✓ v1.0 |
| CSRF disabled globally, tokens on AJAX | Single-admin via Basic Auth, AJAX POSTs protected | ✓ v1.0/v1.5 |
| TemplateManageable interface | Generic dispatch instead of 380 lines duplication | ✓ v1.1 |
| PlayoffService + RaceService split | Focused services instead of God Services | ✓ v1.1 |
| Domain DTO decoupling | Primitive parameters instead of admin DTOs in domain services | ✓ v1.1 |
| RaceGraphicService to admin.service | Fix layering violation — domain must not import admin | ✓ v1.5 |
| SpEL pattern-based validation | Not a full sandbox — sufficient for admin-only templates | ✓ v1.5 |
| CONV-02/03/05 already compliant | Research confirmed no code changes needed | ✓ v1.5 |
| Reuse `GoogleSheetsService` + `DriverMatchingService` + `CsvImportController` preview-state pattern | No parallel import infrastructure | ✓ v1.8 |
| Form-params re-fetch instead of `@SessionAttributes` (D-06) | Stateless controller, predictable transactional boundary, mirrors `CsvImportController` | ✓ v1.8 |
| `@RequestParam` primitives + `Map<String, String>` instead of static Form DTO (D-15 override of QUAL-03 wording) | Per-row keys (`seasonId_<year>`, `skip_<psnId>_<year>`, `accept_<psnId>_<year>`) are dynamic — DTO would not fit | ✓ v1.8 |
| Per-tab cache key for FUZZY-accept driver resolution (CR-01 fix) | Per-tab `accept_<psnId>_<year>` choices must stay isolated; cross-tab dedup keeps plain PSN key for the no-accept branch | ✓ v1.8 |
| Test years 2021/2022 (not 2023/2024) | DevDataSeeder seeds 2023/2024/2026 on context startup → `findByYear()` ambiguity broke conflict-overwrite assertions | ✓ v1.8 |
| Bridge-Spalten-Drop in V6 erweitert (Phase 61 D-01) | matchdays.season_id + playoffs.season_id sind denormalisiert + wartungsbelastend (vs. canonical Season → SeasonPhase → Matchday/Playoff); Phase 56 D-02 / Phase 57 SC5 superseded | ✓ v1.9 |
| Phase-additive entity scope (Phase 56) | Old Season fields + season_id FKs stay until Phase 61 — services migrate before schema cleanup, so Phase 57 data migration runs against a stable surface | ✓ v1.9 |
| `findByType` (Optional) over `findRegularPhase` (throws) for legacy bridge (Phase 58 D-?) | Avoids transaction rollback-only poisoning; pre-V4 seasons fall through gracefully | ✓ v1.9 |
| `PlayoffService.createPlayoff` atomically writes PLAYOFF SeasonPhase + Playoff (Plan 58-05 D-19) | Single `@Transactional` boundary mitigates Pitfall 2 (orphan phase rows on partial failure) | ✓ v1.9 |
| `PlayoffSeedingService` dual-flow: manual seeds win, REGULAR Top-N is fallback (Plan 58-05 D-15) | Preserves legacy admin workflow while adding the new auto-seeding path; PhaseTeam roster on PLAYOFF phase populated as side-effect (D-20) | ✓ v1.9 |
| Driver-import `findByYearAndNumber(int, int)` replaces `findByYear(int)` (Phase 59) | Multi-season-per-year ambiguity resolved at the API surface, not via heuristic; tab pattern extended to `^\d{4}_S\d+$` | ✓ v1.9 |
| Group membership for imported drivers resolved via `PhaseTeam` of the REGULAR phase, not via per-driver sheet override (Phase 59) | Group is a phase-scope property of the team, not a driver attribute — keeps the import sheet shape stable | ✓ v1.9 |
| `TestDataService` + `DevDataSeeder` rebuilt directly on the new model — no Backward-Compat helpers (DATA-01, DATA-02) | Helpers would mask schema regressions; T-prefix isolation keeps fixtures collision-free with manual data | ✓ v1.9 |
| D-19 alltime aggregation spans REGULAR + PLAYOFF + PLACEMENT (Phase 62, TRACKED BEHAVIOR CHANGE) | Public alltime totals include playoff results — explicit user decision to make playoff outcomes count alltime; flagged as behavior change in 62-CONTEXT.md | ✓ v1.9 |
| `templates/site/` mirrors `templates/admin/season-detail.html` two-row tabs structure (Phase 62) | Same UX shape across admin and public site reduces cognitive load for the league operator | ✓ v1.9 |
| Parent-team always wins on shortName multi-match (Phase 70 D-05, inverts Phase 66 D-04) | Domain model: `SeasonDriver.team_id` references parent; sub-team split is per-match via `RaceLineup`, never per-phase. Phase 66 D-04 was a model-violating default discovered during live MariaDB UAT | ✓ v1.9 |
| Group-resolution UX in driver-import preview decommissioned (Phase 70 D-09) | Per Phase-70 D-05 the parent team is the only correct answer; `usesGroups` / `resolvedGroupName` / `TEAM_NOT_IN_REGULAR_PHASE` warning all became dead branches | ✓ v1.9 |
| `findByPsnId` guard in NEW_DRIVER branch of DriverSheetImportService (Phase 70 GAP-70-01 fix) | `computeIfAbsent` did not consult the DB → cross-tab duplicate PSN-ID inserts caused full-transaction rollback on live MariaDB import (Saison 2023). 2 IT regression tests fence the regression | ✓ v1.9 |
| Lombok 1.18.46 + JEP 498 `--sun-misc-unsafe-memory-access=allow` (Phase 68) | Java 25 emits terminally-deprecated warnings for `lombok.permit.Permit`'s `sun.misc.Unsafe` calls; Lombok 1.18.46 + the JEP 498 flag silence the warnings without forcing a Java downgrade | ✓ v1.9 |
| Guava pinned to 33.4.8-jre (`<guava.version>` override) | Transitive Guava 33.1.0-jre from `google-api-client` emitted `AbstractFuture$UnsafeAtomicHelper` Unsafe warning on Java 25; 33.4.x switches to `VarHandle` for Java 9+ | ✓ v1.9 |
| `data_import_audit` permanently out of export scope (Phase 72 D-15) | Audit log is operational metadata about migrations, not league data — survives every import for traceability; enforced structurally via `BackupSchema` package-name filter `org.ctc.domain.model.*` (D-06), so any entity under `org.ctc.backup.*` is excluded with no opt-in / marker / developer memory required | ✓ v1.10 |

### Backup Wire Contract (v1.10)

Phase 72 locked the on-disk wire contract for the backup ZIP before any export/import code was written. Four invariants follow every Phase 72+ backup; importers MUST refuse anything that doesn't match.

**1. Schema versioning is a monotonic integer, not a semver.**
`BackupSchema.SCHEMA_VERSION = 1` (public static final int). Every wire-incompatible schema change bumps the integer by 1. Phase 74's import service rejects ZIPs whose `manifest.json:schema_version` does not equal the current `BackupSchema.SCHEMA_VERSION` BEFORE any DB write (catastrophic-data-loss prevention). GAP-2 resolution.

**2. ZIP layout is per-entity, manifest-first.**
Every backup ZIP contains, in this order:

- `manifest.json` as the FIRST entry (write-order discipline owned by Phase 73's `BackupExportService`).
- Per-entity JSON under `data/`: `data/seasons.json`, `data/season-phases.json`, `data/race-results.json`, etc. Filenames are derived from `@Table(name=...)` via snake_case to kebab-case (`season_phases` becomes `season-phases.json`). `EntityRef.fileName` codifies this rule.
- `uploads/` directory mirroring only entity-referenced files from `data/{profile}/uploads/`.

GAP-1 resolution.

**3. `EXPORT_ORDER` is a JPA-Metamodel-generated topological sort over `org.ctc.domain.model.*`.**
`BackupSchema.@PostConstruct` reads `EntityManagerFactory.getMetamodel().getEntities()`, filters classes by `getPackage().getName().startsWith("org.ctc.domain.model")`, walks each `EntityType<?>`'s `@ManyToOne`/`@OneToOne` owning-side singular attributes, and runs Kahn's algorithm to produce a dependency-first ordered list. The `Team.parentTeam` self-FK is detected and skipped so Kahn does not deadlock. The result is wrapped in `List.copyOf(...)` and exposed via `getExportOrder()`. Hand-rolled FK orderings are forbidden — they drift. GAP-5 resolution.

**4. The 24-entity scope (D-03 corrected post-research: 24 operative entities including `PlayoffRound`).**
The runtime topo-sort returns 24 `EntityRef` instances (CONTEXT.md originally said 23; `PlayoffRound` was missed in D-03 and reconciled in RESEARCH §OQ-1). The 24 are: `Car`, `Track`, `Season`, `SeasonPhase`, `SeasonPhaseGroup`, `Team`, `PhaseTeam`, `SeasonTeam`, `Driver`, `SeasonDriver`, `PsnAlias`, `RaceScoring`, `MatchScoring`, `RaceSettings`, `Matchday`, `Match`, `Race`, `RaceLineup`, `RaceResult`, `RaceAttachment`, `Playoff`, `PlayoffRound`, `PlayoffMatchup`, `PlayoffSeed`. `Car` and `Track` ARE included (D-01: round-trip from environment A to B must not require gt7sync on B first). `FeatureSettings` is DROPPED (D-02: class does not exist in `src/main/java/org/ctc/domain/model/`; if ever introduced, it bumps `SCHEMA_VERSION` 1 to 2). Any new entity under `org.ctc.domain.model` is automatically picked up by the next boot's topo-sort — no marker, no opt-in.

**ObjectMapper isolation (D-11 amended per RESEARCH §Pitfall P-2).**
`BackupObjectMapperConfig` declares BOTH a `@Primary` default mapper (built from the auto-config `Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder`, preserving admin REST/AJAX behaviour) AND a `@Qualifier("backupObjectMapper")` strict mapper (`FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES=true`, `WRITE_DATES_AS_TIMESTAMPS=false`, `JavaTimeModule` registered, Phase 73 MixIn `@Component` beans injected via `List<Module>`). Defining a single qualified bean would silently disable Spring's auto-configured default via `@ConditionalOnMissingBean(ObjectMapper.class)` — verified against spring-projects/spring-boot#47379.

**Audit log persistence (`DataImportAudit` Lombok class, NOT record).**
`org.ctc.backup.audit.DataImportAudit` is a Lombok `@Entity` (Hibernate 7 cannot proxy Java records — RESEARCH §Pitfall P-1 corrects D-08's preference). The entity deliberately does NOT extend `BaseEntity` so the Phase 75 writer fully controls `executedAt` without `AuditingEntityListener` interference. V7 columns use `LONGTEXT` (portable across H2 2.x and MariaDB 10.7+) for the JSON-shape text fields `table_counts_wiped` and `table_counts_restored` (D-09 — native `JSON` rejected for v1.10 dialect drift).
